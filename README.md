üëã Welcome
Hi, and thanks for visiting my GitHub! I'm a data-focused problem solver with a background in business analysis, digital strategy, and game development. I enjoy taking complex challenges‚Äîwhether in the workplace or in a game engine‚Äîand breaking them down into clear, workable systems. This space is where I share some of the projects that reflect that blend of creativity and analytics.

My professional experience comes from roles in the manufacturing and digital marketing space, where I've used tools like SQL, Excel, and Python to dig deep into sales, operations, and customer behavior. I‚Äôve worked cross-functionally with sales teams, procurement, and executive leadership to help businesses optimize how they work. I‚Äôve also managed full-cycle dashboards, sales forecasts, and market analyses to support business decisions at scale.

Outside of the data world, I also work on game design projects. This includes scripting, UX development, and managing collaborative creative workflows. I enjoy learning new tools and creating experiences that are both fun and technically sound.

üîß Skills I Use Often
SQL, Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Data Visualization and Reporting (Dashboards, KPI tracking)

Machine Learning Studio (basic predictive modeling)

Digital Content Creation (Photoshop, Premiere, Capcut)

Audio Engineering and Sound Design

AI (ethical integration into workflows and tools)

ü§ù Let‚Äôs Connect
I‚Äôm always looking to learn more, take on new challenges, or just talk shop. Whether you're working on a data project, game prototype, or something entirely different, I‚Äôm open to collaborating or offering support. Feel free to reach out through GitHub or LinkedIn.
I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out!
